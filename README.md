# Resonate - An Open Source Social Voice Platform

With the rising popularity of social voice platforms such as Clubhouse and Twitter Spaces, it is high time for an Open Source alternative. A platform like this would not only enhance credibility within the open-source community, but also attract more users and foster growth. An engagement platform that is Open Source has the potential to drive significant traction and help establish a strong presence.

## Goals
1.  Design and Develop a Flutter Mobile Application.
2.  Develop a backend for the app using NodeJS, Appwrite and LiveKit.

## Technologies Used

1.  **Flutter** - Mobile application
2.  **Appwrite** - Authentication, Database for Room and Participant management, Storage for user/group data
3.  **NodeJS** - REST API to talk to Livekit & Appwrite
4.  **LiveKit** - Web Real Time Communication

## App Level Design Pattern

Flutter will be used to develop the application for various platforms. We will be designing the app using MVC (Model View Controller) architecture and we will be using GetX for state management.
